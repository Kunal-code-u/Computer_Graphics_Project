# 🌄 2D Village Scene in OpenGL

A 2D animated village scene built using **OpenGL (GLUT)** in **C++**. This project showcases basic computer graphics techniques like drawing primitives, animations, and simple scene composition.

## 📽️ Project Description

This project creates a visually appealing 2D representation of a rural village environment. It is designed as part of an academic exercise to understand OpenGL fundamentals, real-time rendering, and animation in computer graphics.

The scene includes:
- ⛅ Moving clouds and birds
- 🌞 Rising/setting sun
- 🏞️ Flowing river and hills
- 🏡 Houses and trees
- 🚣‍♂️ Boats on water
- 🌾 Fields and natural surroundings

The objects are constructed using OpenGL primitives and animated using GLUT's timer and display functions.
